# Windows 10 Wi-Fi Logger and Resetter
Displays connection status into terminal/log and disables and re-enable adapter if unable to ping Google
in 20 seconds. 

It works.

I'm currently using my neighbors Wi-Fi which doesn't like my laptop adapter. I haven't found out
why yet, but until I do I wrote an app to do what I've been doing manually. Turning the adapter on and off again.
There is a part of me that thinks I'm looking for Python projects more than solutions.

Requires admin privileges and only tested on my Windows 10 laptop.

## Usage
